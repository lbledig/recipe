Chocolate chip Cookies
Instructions 
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Line three baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside.
In a medium bowl mix flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Set aside.
Cream together butter and sugars until combined.
Beat in eggs and vanilla until light (about 1 minute).
Mix in the dry ingredients until combined.
Add chocolate chips and mix well.
Roll 2-3 Tablespoons (depending on how large you like your cookies) of dough at a time into balls and place them evenly spaced on your prepared cookie sheets.
Bake in preheated oven for approximately 8-10 minutes. Take them out when they are just barely starting to turn brown.
Let them sit on the baking pan for 5 minutes before removing to cooling rack.
